# WEBP-to-GIF-converter
# Tried to make some memes so I downloaded some GIF, turned out they were WEBP. WEBP couldn't be edited, at least for now.
# So I decided to use some apps to convert WEBP to GIF but most of them were mediore and good ones wanted me to pay.
# I dont want to pay but still want the goods, so here we are.
How to use:
1) Open the code in Jupiter Notebook or any Python environment
2) Run the code, a new window will show up asking for directory to WEBP's locations. You can select multiple of them and click OK.
3) Let it cook for awhile and you have GIFs. GIF files are saved where WEBP also was, just sort the folder using File Type in Window's right click

Certain improvements that can be made with the code:
I think the code's runtime can be a lot shorter, but IDK how to optimize it more since I don't have full understanding on the image editing package.
I tried to make it into .exe but couldn't install the python's library to do that, so I was stucked on that. But then again, maybe it's not too bad since I can edit the code directly.
